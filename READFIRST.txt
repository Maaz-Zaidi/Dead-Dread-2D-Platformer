To open the program directly, go to DeadDreadV1/bin/Debug/DeadDreadV1.exe (107,153KB)
It can also be opened from the code file in the first folder (Microsoft Visual Studio file) (1KB)

The program required to view the code and open it from the second step is either Visual Basic 2010 express
in which this was made or any Visual Studio program should work too. 

- Extra Info -

This is the third version of the game despite most of its file names. 

This is a very buggy program due to the visual limitations of Visual Basic. It is unfinished due to this fact.
It has a total of 2 levels, 2 types of monsters, 2 obstacles and 4 characters (2 of which are off track).
The art does not belong to me, which is why this game is not "public" except for being showcased on
linkedin. 

(spoilers, not so spoilers)

To beat Level 0, you simply have to jump over the lava at the bottom floor in a pattern before your 
health drains and make it to the other side which is a door.

Level 1 cannot be beat (incomplete) but talking to the NPC allows for a short tutorial, there is 
also a hidden NPC as an easter egg for my friends. 

This program is solely made by me (Maaz Zaidi) in 2018.
